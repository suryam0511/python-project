# Day 01 – Introduction to Python for DevOps

## Task

Today’s goal is to write your **first Python script**.

You will create a Python script that:
- Takes threshold values (CPU, disk, memory) from **user input**
- Also fetches system metrics using a Python library (example: `psutil`)
- Compares metrics against thresholds
- Prints the result to the **terminal**

This is your first step towards thinking like a DevOps engineer using Python.



## Expected Output

- One Python script (example: `system_health.py`)
- Output should be visible in terminal



## Guidelines

- Use:
  - `input()` for user input
  - `if / else` for decision making
  - `for` loops where required
  - Functions to keep the code clean
- Keep the script simple and readable
- Do not over-engineer



## Resources

- Python installation and setup (from live class)
- `psutil` documentation: https://pypi.org/project/psutil/
- Python basics (inputs, conditions, loops, functions)



## Why This Matters for DevOps

DevOps engineers frequently write scripts to:
- Check server health
- Validate system conditions
- Generate reports for monitoring and troubleshooting

This task builds the foundation for **automation, monitoring, and reliability**.



## Submission

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your script inside the `day-01` folder
3. Ensure the script runs successfully
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork



## Learn in Public

Share your progress on LinkedIn:
- Post a small code snippet or a story on how you wrote your first Python Script
- Share the output from the terminal
- Write 2–3 lines on what you learned today (can be a blog article as well)

Optional:
- Tag **TrainWithShubham** or **Shubham Londhe** 
- Use hashtags: `#PythonForDevOps #TrainWithShubham #DevOpsKaJosh` (Helps me to filter post and Like/ Comment / Repost / engage)
